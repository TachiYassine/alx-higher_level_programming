# Database Overview and MySQL Guide

## General

### What’s a Database
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data.

### What’s a Relational Database
A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Data in a relational database is organized into tables, which are composed of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity and its attributes, and relationships between tables are defined through keys.

### What Does SQL Stand For
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating databases.

### What’s MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on SQL. It is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation. MySQL is widely used for web databases and is a component of the LAMP web application software stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python).
